        <h2>Who was Albert Einstein</h2>
        <p><strong>Albert Einstern</strong> is a German-born Physicist who developed the special and general theories of <strong>relativity</strong> and won a Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of <strong>Photoelectric effect</strong>. He ia generally considered the most influential Physicist of 20th Century</p>

    <h2>The Early Life Albert Einstein</h2>
    <p class>He had a adventurous mind and would very often wonder about a lot of things particularly,the ones that deaply affected his early years. The first was his encounter with a compass at the age of five. He was mystified that invisible forces could deflect the needle. Which lead to a lifelong facination with invisible forces. The second came at the age of twelve when he dicovered a book of geometry which he studied cover to cover, calling it his "sarced little geometry book".</p>
    <p>Einstein became deeply religious at the age of twelve composing songs, fellowshipping with God but it began to change after reading books that contradicted his religious beliefs. This lead him to feel out of place and was victimized by Prussian style educational system that stifle originality and creativity. he was even told he would not amount to anything by one of his teachers. </p>
 <P>Though Einstein faced a lot if difficulites and challenges on his path to make known and achieve his ideas he never gave up and keep on try with the help of people he was able to get to his destination</P>
 <h2>Einstein Achievements</h2>
 <p>He formulated the princple of relativity which stated " the speed of light is a constant in any inertial frame(constantly moving frame)</p>
 <p>In 1905 he published four papers in the  Annalen der physik  which are:</p>
 <ul>
     <li>On Heuristic Viewpoint concerning the production of light, he applied the quantum thoery to light in order to explain the photoelectric effect</li>
     <li>On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat, in which he offered the first expermential proof of the existence of atoms.</li>
     <li>On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies in which he laid out the mathematical thoery of special relativity.</li>
     <li>Answer the question ("Does the inertia of a Body Depnds Upon its Energy Contnet?") in which he submitted almost am afterthought, whic showed that relativity thoery led to the equation E=mc^2. This provided the first mechanism to expalin the energy source of the Sun and other stars.</li>
     <p>Einstein was also the first to assemble the whole theory of special relativity together and to realize that it was a universal law of nature.</p>
     <h2>Albert Einstein's Death</h2>
     <p>After suffering an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture several days before, Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, at the age of 76. The Great Legacy of Albert Einstein shall forever be a source of inspiration and hope to future generations to come.</p>
